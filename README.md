# Stack Salaries
Team Onix: [Minh](https://github.com/Minyens), [Nahee](https://github.com/naheeyahh), [AJ](https://github.com/ajzawawi)

An app for software engineers to post anonymous salary info based on their stack and location with optional filters based on criteria such as educational background, age, years of experience.

# Back end

The back-end currently uses Express/MongoDB/Mongoose.
As part of the current webpack config file, the server is compiled every time you run
`npm start`

```
server
│   secret    - This contains the secret token for passport authentication
│   server-c  - The compiled version of the server
│   server    - The server file
│
└─── controllers
    │   stackdataController  - Holds all the helper methods needed to query the database for stack entries
    │
    │
└─── models
    │   stackdata   - The stack entry model
    │   user        - The user model
└─── passport
    │   github      - Github authentication strategy (you can utilize and include on the frontend)
    │   local       - This authentication strategy verifies the email and password upon login
    │   passport    - This authentication strategy verifies a valid JWT token was sent in
                      the header for protected areas
└─── public
    │               Contains old HTML files, feel free to ignore
```

# Front-end

The front-end utilizes Redux/React.
As part of the current webpack config, the client/src file is compiled every time you run
`npm start`.
Helpful hint: If you don't want to wait that long, run `npm run quick`, this only compiles
the client side.

```
client
│   secret    - This contains the secret token for passport authentication
│   server-c  - The compiled version of the server
│   server    - The server file
│
└─── compiled
    │   stackdataController  -
    │
    │
└─── src
